Visual changes after installation are a normal part of the adhesive bonding process. When the haziness/milky look and water pockets have disappeared, the film is considered dry or “cured” and is safe to clean. Depending on the product and temperature, it may take up to 60 days for the film to fully cure. You may clean the inside surface with any normal household strength glass cleaner and a soft lint-free cloth.DO NOT USE abrasive cleaners, industrial strength glass cleaners or other window cleaning tools that may scratch the window film. For best results, avoid cleaning in direct sunlight.</p>
